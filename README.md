# T-OPT-Cache-Replacement-Policy

As a part of the courses "Computer Architecture" and "Computer Architecture Lab" (IITB: CS 305 and CS 341) , we had decided to implement a research paper "T-OPT replacement policy for graphs" as our course project. This is the implementation code of the same.

This is the link to the paper: https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vigneshb/papers/hpca21.pdf

We have tried to implement the paper using Champsim.

Division of labour:Â Paper review and formulation of initial strategies - All the team members

Trying out initial strategies - Krushnakant & Ridayesh, Adarsh & Aman - worked in groups of two

PIN coding - Aman & Adarsh

Algo implementation - Ridayesh & Krushnakant

Final debugging & ppt - Adarsh, Aman, Ridayesh, Krushnakant
